5-17-2017: Gerbil-v0.8.1
- compiler/optimize: fix bug where prelude ssxi loading short-circuited further deps
- compiler/driver: fix bug in static exe dependency collection where the prelude module deps where short-circuited
- std/make: honour verbosity in exe compilation

5-16-2017: Gerbil-v0.8
- compiler: optimizer improvements and static executables
  - optimizer:
    - track types for local bindings
    - lift locally defined opt/case-lambdas
    - attach inline rules to !lambdas for more complex call optimization transforms
    - track prelude imports to optimize custom preludes deeply
  - driver:
    - support static compilation
      - static: option for compiling library modules for static linkage
      - compile-static-exe for statically linked executables
    - default output directory for executables to current dir
  - gxc:
    - -static option for static compilation
    - -gsc-option and -gsc-option2 for adding arbitrary compilation options for gsc
    - print usage when invoked with no files and fix error when invoked with only options
- runtime:
  - find-method now caches struct method resolutions to the rtd vtab
- prelude:
  - extend core.ssxi to include more of the runtime and inline all simple procedures
- stdlib:
  - build static linkage modules for all stdlib
  - std/make supports static library compilation and executables
  - actor/rpc fix latent arity bug caught by the optimizer
- build:
  - [fare] use /bin/sh -eu for build scripts

5-11-2017: Gerbil-v0.7
- compiler: modularize and implement optimizer pass
  - optimizations:
    - lift opt lambdas and case-lambdas and optimize direct call dispatch
    - recognize struct MOP definitions and inline direct struct operations
    - cross module optimization with concurrent compilation and ssxi module generation
    - ssxi prelude for writing type declarations for the optimizer
  - gxc:
    - add -O and -no-ssxi options for optimization
    - add -cc-options and -ld-options for gsc compilation flags
    - add -h option for printing usage
- runtime:
  - new MOP functions: class-subtype? next-method call-next-method
- stdlib
  - std/text/zlib
    - support transparent gzip/deflate decompression
    - support gz compression
    - support compression and decompression of input ports
  - std/net/request
    - accept gzip/deflate encoding with transparent content decompression
  - std/iter
    - accept when and unless filters in for and it's variants
    - optimize iter transforms to use a direct iterator instead of a coroutine
    - make coroutine and input-port iter-value idempotent between iter-next calls
  - std/srfi/9
    - generate record constructor that is recognized by the optimizer
    - use interned symbols for module scoped records, as in defstruct
  - std/misc/queue and std/test
    - fix accessor bugs caught by the optimizer
