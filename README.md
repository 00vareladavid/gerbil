# Gerbil Scheme

Gerbil is a new dialect of Scheme, designed around a multiresolution
macro-system.

The macro system is based on quote-syntax, and provides full the
meta-syntactic tower with a native implementation of syntax-case.
It also provides a full-blown module system, similar to PLT Scheme's
(sorry, racket) modules. The main difference from plt's modules is that
Gerbil modules are single instantiation, supporting high performance ahead
of time compilation.

## History of Gerbil
Gerbil has been my private Scheme for many years, evolved out of a set
of common macros that i used across different implementations. As such
i have multiple backends that work with the Gerbil macro system, but I
have elected to base the primary version of Gerbil on Gambit.

At the prompting of fare and mikael (they know who they are), who
had seen private versions of Gerbil, I decided to release it in public
with a clean bootstrap version that bootstraps on gambit with a precompiled
version of the macro system and a compiler for Gambit.
That means that the system is entirely self-hosted in Gambit.

# License and Copyright

The source code is distributed under the Gambit license; that means
that Gerbil on Gambit is dual licensed under LGPLv2.1 and Apache 2.0.

Gerbil's primary author and maintainer is vyzo-at-hackzen.org, aka in
the Net as Dimitris Vyzovitis. The obligatory copyright notice, had I
bothered polluted everything with more than a (C) vyzo at hackzen.org,
would read like this:

# Installation
## Source Code
The source code for Gerbil is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/vyzo/gerbil).
You can obtain the source tree directly in the command line by checking
out the sources:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/vyzo/gerbil.git
```

## Dependencies
I have tested the bootstrap with Gambit v4.8.4, but older versions
starting with v4.6.0 should work as well.

The `:std/xml` library in std requires libxml2 to build; comment it out
xml stuffs in `src/std/build.ss` if you don't have it.

The `:std/crypto` library in std requires libcrypto from openssl; similary
comment out the crypto stuffs in `build.ss` if you don't have it.

The current std library is an initial packaging of libraries that worked
with the Gambit bootstrap out of the box. I am continuously porting
more libraries from the various private versions of Gerbil, so you should
expect more libraries to be continously merged.

## Build Instructions
After checking out the source code from Github, let `$GERBIL_HOME` be
the top directory of Gerbil.
Then:
```
$ cd $GERBIL_HOME/src
$ ./build.sh
```

this will execute a full bootstrap build in place, starting from the
pre-compiled Scheme sources in `$GERBIL_HOME/src/bootstrap`.

# Using Gerbil
The Gerbil interpreter is `$GERBIL_HOME/bin/gxi`, and the compiler is
`$GERBIL_HOME/bin/gxc`.

If you want an interactive Gerbil shell just execute the interpreter
directly by running gxi.

If you want to write an executable Gerbil script, add `$GERBIL_HOME/bin`
to your `PATH` and use the following for your magic:
```
#!/usr/bin/env gxi-script
```

You can define a main procedure in your script that will receive
the command line arguments.

For an example script, put the following in hello.ss
```
#!/usr/bin/env gxi-script

(def (main . args)
 (displayln "Hello world! My arguments are " args))
```

Running the script with
```
chmod +x hello.ss
./hello.ss 1 2 3
```

should produce the following output:
```
Hello world! My arguments are (1 2 3)
```

# Documentation

There is no further documentation at this point, because I haven't
had the time to prepare some nice and coherent documentation that
can help Scheme neophytes -- or people who like neat documentation
before using a new Scheme system. I hope to write some real
documentation in the not-so-distant future. Check the Github
repository, as I intend to host documentation directly on Github
with github-pages.

Probably the best way to dive into gerbil is by reading the sources,
as all the main language features are exercised in one way or another
within the implementation.
The core language macros are defined in `src/gerbil/prelude/core.ss`.
This is the language that you get in the interpreter and what is available
when writing a new module without explicitly specifying a prelude.

# Epilogue

Gerbil is under continuous use and development.
The core language has been stable for a while, but I am busy porting
batteries for the std library.

Patches (even for typos in the comments) are always welcome.
No copyright assignment ever, you keep what you contribute.
